# Introduction

This document is for test-weekers, potential and new hires, as well as those generally curious. It will give you a quick overview over how we work here in the Toggl mobile team, where you can get started, and what is expected of you.

## Working in the Toggl mobile team

Besides GitHub, the Toggl mobile team organizes and communicates almost exclusively in **#mobile-dev** on Slack. The team is led by **@heidi** (team-lead and designer) and **@paul** (technical lead), and you can find all other team members in the user group **@mobileteam**. 

Feel free to talk to anyone privately, but in general it is best to ask questions and have discussions in **#mobile-dev** so that others can weigh in.

Most of our work is organised through GitHub issues and milestones. In principle you can work on any issue, but we usually mark several that are easy to pick up with the `test-week` label. For more details on our precise workflows, please check [further documentation](https://github.com/toggl/mobile-docs#toggl-mobile-team-documentation "Toggl Mobile Team Documentation").


## Get Started 

Here is a quick checklist to get you started:
- _(test weekers only)_ Make sure to track all the time you work for us with Toggl. You will be paid according to the report you send us after your test week.
- Read at least the repository's readme, and if needed any documentation linked from there to familiarize yourself with our best practices.
- Clone the repository on your machine and make sure the app is running properly.
- Check out the current milestones, to get an overview of what we are working on right now.
- When you start working on an issue, make sure to assign it to yourself so everyone knows what you are working on.
- Please ask questions if anything is unclear, and make sure to communicate what you are working on.


## Test Weeks - What we expect

The point of a test week at Toggl is not just to see if you have the technical skills that we are looking for, but also if you are a good fit for our team.

We want you to work _with_ us just as if you were already hired. That means you should feel free to participate in discussions, comment on issues, review pull requests, etc. if you think you have something to contribute.

Depending on the work available during your test week we expect you to finish at least a few different issues, and we might tell you to work on specific ones if we want to see how you handle specific challenges. We don't expect your work to be perfect, just that you give your best.
