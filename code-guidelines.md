# Code Guidelines

These are coding guidelines we adhere to independent of language used. 

Check each app's individual repository for language and app specific guidelines.

## Comments

We generally do not like comments in code.

The only comments allowed are those that need to exist because there is no other way of expressing the same information. This basically narrows it down to comments that explain weird hacks, workarounds or similar that are not obvious and could not be avoided.

Specifically, `TODO` comments are not allowed on `develop`. Instead, the feature should be finished properly, or an issue created/a comment added to the relevant issue.
